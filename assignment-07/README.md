assignment7.c is the solution to h0mbre's [assignment 7](https://github.com/h0mbre/Learning-C/tree/master/Assignment-07).

I also attempted to write a safe version of assignment7 with validation and error checks on the input (which is titled assignment7-extra.c).
Felix Palmen's [beginners' guide away from scanf()](https://www.sekrit.de/webdocs/c/beginners-guide-away-from-scanf.html) helped significantly in this process.
